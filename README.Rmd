# AWS Comprehend Client Package

**aws.comprehend** is a package for natural language processing.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and to enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. The [**aws.iam** package](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.iam) profiles tools for working with IAM, including creating roles, users, groups, and credentials programmatically; it is not needed to *use* IAM credentials.

A detailed description of how credentials can be specified is provided at: https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature/. The easiest way is to simply set environment variables on the command line prior to starting R or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file, which are used to set environment variables in R during startup (see `? Startup`). They can be also set within R:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",
           "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" = "mytoken")
```

## Code Examples

Here are some simple code examples:

```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# to prevent data.frame wrapping in the outputs below
options(width=120)
```

```{r}
library("aws.comprehend")

# simple language detection
detect_language("This is a test sentence in English")

# multi-lingual language detection
detect_language("A: ¡Hola! ¿Como está, usted? B: Bien, merci. Et toi?")

# sentiment analysis
detect_sentiment("I have never been happier. This is the best day ever.")

# named entity recognition
txt <- c("Amazon provides web services.", "Jeff is their leader.")
detect_entities(txt)

# key phrase detection
detect_phrases(txt)

# syntax analysis
detect_syntax("The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
```

All of the functions accept either a single character string or a character vector.
