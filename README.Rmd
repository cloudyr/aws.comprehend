**aws.comprehend** is a package for natural language processing.

## Code Examples


All of the functions (except `detect_medical_*`) accept either a single character string or a character vector. Note that AWS currently limits batch queries to 25 documents, so character vectors should have 25 elements maximum.

The default language is English (`"en"`) but this is easily changed using the `language` argument.


```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# to prevent data.frame wrapping in the outputs below
options(width = 150)
```

### Sentiment analysis

```{r}
library("aws.comprehend")

detect_sentiment("I have never been happier. This is the best day ever.")

# Sentiment analysis in Spanish
detect_sentiment("¡Hoy estoy feliz!", language = "es")
```

### Language detection

```{r}
# simple language detection
detect_language("This is a test sentence in English")

# multi-lingual language detection
detect_language("A: ¡Hola! ¿Como está, usted? B: Bien, merci. Et toi?")
```

### Named Entity Recognition

```{r}
txt <- c("Amazon provides web services.", "Jeff is their leader.")
detect_entities(txt)
```

### Key Phrase Detection

```{r}
txt <- c("Amazon provides web services.", "Jeff is their leader.")
detect_phrases(txt)
```

### Syntax Analysis

```{r}
detect_syntax("The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
```

### Medical Entity and Personal Health Information (PHI) Detection

```{r}
# medical entity detection
medical_txt <- "Pt is 40yo mother, highschool teacher. HPI : Sleeping trouble on present dosage of Clonidine."
detect_medical_entities(medical_txt)

# Protected Health Information (PHI) detection
detect_medical_phi(medical_txt)
```


## Setting up credentials

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and to enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. The [**aws.iam** package](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.iam) profiles tools for working with IAM, including creating roles, users, groups, and credentials programmatically; it is not needed to *use* IAM credentials.

A detailed description of how credentials can be specified is provided at: https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature/. The easiest way is to simply set environment variables on the command line prior to starting R or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file, which are used to set environment variables in R during startup (see `? Startup`). They can be also set within R:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",
           "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" = "mytoken")
```


## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN or, to install the latest development version, from the cloudyr drat repository:

```R
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("aws.comprehend")

# Latest version passing CI tests, from drat repo
install.packages("aws.comprehend", repos = c(getOption("repos"), "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat"))
```

You can also pull a potentially unstable version directly from GitHub, using the `remotes` package:

```R
remotes::install_github("cloudyr/aws.comprehend")
```
